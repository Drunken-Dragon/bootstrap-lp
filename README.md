# bootstrap-lp
A sample landing page created with Bootstrap.
The project now continues as a part of my development training tasks. The last change was creating a form handling and validation, for the form on the LP.

Currently the project contains: new sign up and log in mechanisms, and the landing page index.php is protected by the login site. Logout mechanism has also been added.

Files have been ordered into two directories - web and resources. htaccess file created, containing rewrite module and rule removing .php file extensions in the web browser.

Composer has been added to the project. Code Sniffer tool has been added to the project. PSR2 rules have been applied to php files. Readme MD file duplicate has been removed from src directory.
