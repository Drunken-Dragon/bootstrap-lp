# bootstrap-lp
A sample landing page created with Bootstrap.
The project now continues as a part of my development training tasks. The last change was creating a form handling and validation, for the form on the LP.

Currently the project contains: new sign up and log in mechanisms, and the landing page index.php is protected by the login site. Logout mechanism has also been added.
